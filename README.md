# wave_modelling_MScDiss_JU
This repository is a collection of two files used for Jack Unsworth's MSc Project titled "Wave Modelling using Finite Element Methods".
The file "timesteppers.py" contains both the timestepping schemes, and the file "run_wave_model.py" contains everything else.
After downloading, run "python run_wave_model.py" in the command line along with the correct arguments shown in "run_wave_model.py"
